              <p>
              First Principles Advisory Group is a boutique management consultancy focused exclusively on the healthcare industry. We were founded in 2010 and are located in the San Francisco Bay Area.<br><br>
              We set ourselves apart from typical life sciences consultancies in several ways: (1) we focus on both strategy and the operational implementation of our work; (2) we provide seasoned partners and project leaders as dedicated points of contact on all our projects; (3) we exhibit a breadth and depth of in-house industry and consulting experiences.<br><br>
              We have extensive, long term relationships with large, <u>Fortune 500 public companies, mid-size firms, well-financed early stage companies, and venture capital firms.</u> <br><br>
